//! Phonon: text to 24 kHz speech, on device.
//!
//! Text is tokenized, a flow-matching language model turns the tokens into Mimi
//! codec latents, and the Mimi decoder turns those into PCM. Generation is
//! streaming throughout: latents are decoded as they are produced.
//!
//! # Getting started
//!
//! [`synth::Synth`] is the whole pipeline behind one call:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # fn main() -> ptts::Result<()> {
//! use ptts::preprocess::Lang;
//! use ptts::synth::Synth;
//! use ptts::tts_model::TTSConfig;
//!
//! let tts = Synth::builder(
//!     TTSConfig::v202601(),
//!     "model/model.safetensors",
//!     Lang::En,
//! )
//! .tokenizer_file("model/tokenizer.json")
//! .add_voice("alba", "model/voices/alba.safetensors")
//! .build()?;
//! let pcm = tts.say("Hello world")?;
//! ptts::wav::write_wav_file("out.wav", &pcm, tts.sample_rate())?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Layers
//!
//! | Module | Role |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`synth`] | The one-call API: load, prime, generate, decode. Start here. |
//! | [`loader`] | Reading weights and voice files, and the checkpoint key mapping. |
//! | [`error`] | [`Error`], what those two return. |
//! | [`plan`] | Frame and KV budgets, the end-of-speech policy. |
//! | [`preprocess`] | Per-language text normalization, applied before tokenizing. |
//! | [`tok`] | The Hugging Face tokenizer, behind the `hf` feature. |
//! | [`audio`] | Decoding and resampling audio files for voice cloning, behind `audio`. |
//! | [`tts_model`] | [`tts_model::TTSModel`], the streaming primitives `synth` drives. |
//! | [`flow_lm`], [`transformer`] | The token-conditioned flow-matching LM. |
//! | [`mimi`] | The neural audio codec. |
//!
//! # Errors
//!
//! [`synth`] and [`loader`] return [`Error`]; the model modules below them keep `xn::Result`,
//! because a shape mismatch inside the codec is not something a caller acts on. `?` crosses the
//! boundary in both directions, so a frontend whose own functions return `xn::Result` keeps
//! compiling. The variants are failure classes, so a binding maps them onto its host language's
//! exceptions in one match.
//!
//! Which files a checkpoint ships, and what they are called, is the caller's to
//! know: `ptts` reads the config, weights, tokenizer and voice files it is
//! handed, and never guesses at names or downloads anything itself.
//!
//! Text is normalized before it is tokenized — see [`preprocess`]. Which
//! language, or [`preprocess::Normalize::OFF`], is a required argument to
//! [`synth::SynthBuilder::new`]: the model reads normalized text noticeably
//! better, but the spoken forms are per-language, so guessing is worse than
//! doing nothing.
//!
//! A voice is conditioned on once per [`synth::Synth`], whichever entry point
//! is used; [`synth::SynthApi::session`] additionally pins the KV budget for a
//! stream of requests.
//!
//! Callers that need to drive the loop themselves — a browser build stepping
//! from an event loop, with no threads to spawn — should use
//! [`tts_model::TTSModel`] directly. `Synth` is a composition of those
//! primitives, not a replacement for them.
