//! The error type the API layer returns.
//!
//! [`crate::synth`] and [`crate::loader`] return [`Error`]; the model modules below them
//! ([`crate::tts_model`], [`crate::flow_lm`], [`crate::mimi`] and friends) keep `xn::Result`,
//! because a shape mismatch inside the codec is not something a caller acts on. `?` crosses the
//! boundary in both directions: [`Error`] is `From<xn::Error>`, and `xn::Error` is `From<Error>`,
//! so a frontend whose own functions return `xn::Result` keeps compiling.
//!
//! The variants are failure *classes*, not one per message: three of this repo's frontends are
//! bindings, and what each needs is to turn a failure into the right kind of exception. So a
//! binding matches the enum once, as a table:
//!
//! ```
//! # use ptts::Error;
//! fn exception_for(e: &Error) -> &'static str {
//!     match e {
//!         Error::InvalidArgument(_) => "ValueError",
//!         Error::UnknownVoice { .. } | Error::NotFound(_) => "LookupError",
//!         Error::Unsupported(_) => "NotImplementedError",
//!         // `Error` is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so a variant added later lands here rather than
//!         // being silently folded into one of the above.
//!         _ => "RuntimeError",
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Two variants carry fields instead of only a message, because a caller does something with
//! them: [`Error::UnknownVoice`] hands back the names that would have worked, and
//! [`Error::SeqBudgetExceeded`] hands back the budget this text needs.
